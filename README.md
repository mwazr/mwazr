# About Me

Hi! Welcome to my GitHub profile. I am a microeconomist with research interests in the industrial organization of information producers and the political economy of media markets.

My research approach combines microeconomic theory, applied econometrics, and machine learning to investigate the dynamics of information environments and their broader societal impacts. During my Ph.D., I used a model of misspecified learning and game theory to explain the rise of media bias in traditional news markets and introduce a media-driven mechanism of rising political polarization. I also leveraged the semantic representation capabilities of large language models, combined with supervised and unsupervised machine learning methods, to distinguish granular partisan positions from social media text data and develop a measure of media bias. Additionally, I applied network theory and epidemiological modeling tools to study misinformation spread through social networks, highlighting the mechanisms of information diffusion and the complexities of fact-checking interventions aimed at mitigating misinformation.
