# About Me

Hi! Welcome to my GitHub profile. I am an applied economic theorist who uses econometric and machine learning tools to understand and measure various dynamics of our information environment.

My job market paper titled ``Media Bias and Offline Polarization in the Online Era" explores the strategic interactions between media firms in a market where Bayesian consumers judge accuracy of news signals using misspecified statistical models of the world. I show that if more informed audiences are disproportionately drawn away from the audience of the media firms, news firms respond by increasing the partisanship of their news report. This mechanism leads to an increase in disagreements between conservative and liberal audiences that rely most on traditional news sources without any changes in the ideological dsitribution of the population.
